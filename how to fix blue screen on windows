The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is a critical error that occurs when your computer encounters a problem that it cannot recover from. It is usually accompanied by a message that provides information about the cause of the error. If you are experiencing the BSOD on your Windows 10 computer, here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot and fix the issue:
Restart your computer: The first step you should try is simply restarting your computer. This will often resolve the issue if it is caused by a temporary problem or software glitch.
Check for updates: If the BSOD occurred after installing a new piece of software or a Windows update, there may be an issue with the update itself. Check for any available updates and install them to see if that resolves the issue.
Check for hardware issues: If the BSOD is caused by a hardware issue, you may need to troubleshoot and fix the problem. Check that all your hardware is properly connected and seated, and try running a hardware diagnostic tool to check for any issues.
Check for malware: Malware can cause a variety of problems on your computer, including the BSOD. Run a scan with your antivirus software to check for and remove any malware that may be present on your system
Reset your computer: If none of the above steps help, you may need to reset your computer to its default state. To do this, go to the "Update & Security" section of the Settings app and select "Recovery." From there, you can choose to reset your computer and start fresh with a clean installation of Windows.
